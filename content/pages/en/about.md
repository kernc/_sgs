The small chamber ensemble  **_Slovenian String Sextet_** has been performing since september 2017,
when, in making a gesture of respect and as a tribute in memory of
[**prof. Tomaž Lorenz**](https://www.google.com/search?q=tomaž+lorenz),
the musicians, in collaboration with Ljubljana Musical Youth, gathered in Ljubljana City Museum
to hold a concert, which has since grown into a real musical tradition in the cycle of _"Autumn Serenades"_.
Due to past successes and mutual interest in making chamber music,
a permanent ensemble was formed:
**Ana Dolžan** and **Vid Sajovic** on violin,
**Nejc Mikolič** and **Anuša Plesničar** on viola, and
**Izak Hudnik** and **Katarina Kozjek** on cello.
Members of the Slovenian String Sextet gained their education both at home and abroad
(Ljubljana, Vienna, Detmold, Rotterdam, Zurich, Salzburg).
In addition to performing in a chamber ensemble, they also regularly
participate in larger orchestras
(Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra, KSO Klagenfurt, RTV Slovenia Symphony Orchestra, etc.)
and maintain ties in pedagogical activity
(Academy of Music of the University of Ljubljana, Conservatory of Music and Ballet Ljubljana,
Music School Škofja Loka, Kranj Music School, etc.).
Their work often reaches into research fields of philosophy and musicology.

... The fullness of the string sound was what the sextet,
established as a project ensemble in 2017, already has pedigree for.
It sounded like the musicians have had behind them god knows how many decades
of work and joint music creation. This was pointed out by the constant pulsation of the six,
which has built string interpretations on excellent technical elements,
available to each individual and all of them combined ...

In the past years, the ensemble has performed numerous concerts across Slovenia
(Ljubljana, Celje, Vrhnika, Kropa, etc.).
In 2021, two new music cycles were formed: the first one with a poetic name
_"24 strings in the atrium"_, a series of concerts in the Atrium ZRC SAZU in
Ljubljana, promoting, by performance, the musical novelties of many Slovenian composers.
The second new cycle is
["_DermotAbonma_"](https://kultura-kropa.si/dermotabonma/)
in Kropa in Upper Carniola,
dedicated to Slovenian tenor
[**Anton Dermota**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Dermota),
in collaboration with successful Slovenian singers:
**Klemen Torkar**,
[**Liza Šparovec**](https://lizasparovec.com),
**Tomaž Štular** and
[**Irma Mihelič**](http://www.opera4u.com/en/artists/detail/mihelic/).
In addition, Slovenian composer
[**Larisa Vrhunc**](https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2005023988/)
dedicated her composition entitled _"String Sextet"_ to our chamber ensemble,
and in December 2020, the sextet received an offer for studio recording (Krek, Dvořák)
in collaboration with Radio and television of Slovenia.

For members of our sextet, chamber music, among other musical fields,
represents the crown jewel of musical creation and fulfills them both professionally and personally.
In addition to the quality of their program, their main contributions are ardent promotion of
newly written Slovenian works for string sextet and a strongly emphasized educational component.

The ensemble of two violins, two violas and two violoncellos, thus, consists of:
