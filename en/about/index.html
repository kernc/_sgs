<h1>About</h1>
<p itemprop="description">The small chamber ensemble  <strong><em>Slovenian String Sextet</em></strong> has been performing since september 2017,
when, in making a gesture of respect and as a tribute in memory of
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=toma≈æ+lorenz"><strong>prof. Toma≈æ Lorenz</strong></a>,
the musicians, in collaboration with Ljubljana Musical Youth, gathered in Ljubljana City Museum
to hold a concert, which has since grown into a real musical tradition in the cycle of <em>‚ÄúAutumn Serenades‚Äù</em>.
Due to past successes and mutual interest in making chamber music,
a permanent ensemble was formed:
<strong>Ana Dol≈æan</strong> and <strong>Vid Sajovic</strong> on violin,
<strong>Nejc Mikoliƒç</strong> and <strong>Anu≈°a Plesniƒçar</strong> on viola, and
<strong>Izak Hudnik</strong> and <strong>Katarina Kozjek</strong> on cello.
Members of the Slovenian String Sextet gained their education both at home and abroad
(Ljubljana, Vienna, Detmold, Rotterdam, Zurich, Salzburg).
In addition to performing in a chamber ensemble, they also regularly
participate in larger orchestras
(Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra, <span class="caps">KSO</span> Klagenfurt, <span class="caps">RTV</span> Slovenia Symphony Orchestra, etc.)
and maintain ties in pedagogical activity
(Academy of Music of the University of Ljubljana, Conservatory of Music and Ballet Ljubljana,
Music School ≈†kofja Loka, Kranj Music School, etc.).
Their work often reaches into research fields of philosophy and¬†musicology.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.sigic.si/jesenske-serenade-2020.html" style="font-size: .9em; font-weight: 100; font-style: italic;"><p>
‚Ä¶ The fullness of the string sound was what the sextet,
established as a project ensemble in 2017, already has pedigree for.
It sounded like the musicians have had behind them god knows how many decades
of work and joint music creation. This was pointed out by the constant pulsation of the six,
which has built string interpretations on excellent technical elements,
available to each individual and all of them combined¬†‚Ä¶
</p></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left:40px; font-size: .8em; font-weight: 400; text-align: start;"><strong>Franc Kri≈ænar</strong>, <span class="caps">SIGIC</span> ‚Äî Autumn serenades¬†2020</p>
<p>In the past years, the ensemble has performed numerous concerts across Slovenia
(Ljubljana, Celje, Vrhnika, Kropa, etc.).
In 2021, two new music cycles were formed: the first one with a poetic name
<em>‚Äú24 strings in the atrium‚Äù</em>, a series of concerts in the Atrium <span class="caps">ZRC</span> <span class="caps">SAZU</span> in
Ljubljana, promoting, by performance, the musical novelties of many Slovenian composers.
The second new cycle is
<a href="https://kultura-kropa.si/dermotabonma/">‚Äú<em>DermotAbonma</em>‚Äù</a>
in Kropa in Upper Carniola,
dedicated to Slovenian tenor
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Dermota"><strong>Anton Dermota</strong></a>,
in collaboration with successful Slovenian singers:
<strong>Klemen Torkar</strong>,
<a href="https://lizasparovec.com"><strong>Liza ≈†parovec</strong></a>,
<strong>Toma≈æ ≈†tular</strong> and
<a href="http://www.opera4u.com/en/artists/detail/mihelic/"><strong>Irma Miheliƒç</strong></a>.
In addition, Slovenian composer
<a href="https://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-no2005023988/"><strong>Larisa Vrhunc</strong></a>
dedicated her composition entitled <em>‚ÄúString Sextet‚Äù</em> to our chamber ensemble,
and in December 2020, the sextet received an offer for studio recording (Krek, Dvo≈ô√°k)
in collaboration with Radio and television of¬†Slovenia.</p>

<p><strong>For members of our sextet, chamber music, among other musical fields,
represents the crown jewel of musical creation and fulfills them both professionally and personally.
In addition to the quality of their program, their main contributions are ardent promotion of
newly written Slovenian works for string sextet and a strongly emphasized educational¬†component.</strong></p>
<p>The ensemble of two violins, two violas and two violoncellos, thus, consists¬†of:</p>
